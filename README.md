# Salamis

Contextual vscode extension management

## Problem

- Many extensions are installed, but only a fraction are used per project. Domain/Language specific extensions are still loaded, even if they may not be applicable
- Enabling / disabling them per workspace is not a proper solution

## Solution

- Extensions are categorized by domain/language/purpose
- Extensions can be launched by any combination of these tags

Launch Command:

```sh
salamis launch JavaScript
# is an abstraction over
code --extensions-dir ~/.cache/salamis/workspaces/JavaScript
```

Configuration File:

```toml
[[workspaces]]
name = "JavaScript"
description = "JavaScript / TypeScript Development Environment"
use = [
	"core", "javascript"
]

[[extensions]]
name = "editorconfig.editorconfig"
tags = [
	"core"
]

[[extensions]]
name = "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
tags = [
	"core"
]

[[extensions]]
name = "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
tags = [
	"javascript"
]
```

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hyperupcall/salamis
cd ./salamis
bake build
./salamis
```

## Roadmap

- Make list also show all extensions that a workspace owns (via inspecting the tags)
